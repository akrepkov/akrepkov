# Hi there! 👋

I'm Anna, just a regular person with a knack for technology and a passion for problem-solving. My journey has taken me through various roles, shaping me into the person I am today. Over the last 10 years, I've done a bit of everything: from editing websites using WordPress and fixing HTML and CSS issues to organizing projects that solve city problems through crowdsourcing.

But life, much like programming, is about adapting and evolving. So, here I am, embracing the challenge of learning data analytics on Coursera and diving into the world of software engineering at Codam College, where I'm learning C.

### You might wonder, why C? 
Let me break it down for you. C isn't just a language; it's like exploring the hidden connection between hardware and software. Imagine it as being the conductor of an orchestra, where C developers like me delve into the core of computers, grasping their essence, and crafting intricate pieces of code.

In conclusion, I want to say that my experiences have taught me the art of problem-solving, the importance of teamwork, and the resilience to face setbacks with a smile. After all, in the world of tech, bugs are just unexpected plot twists waiting to be resolved.
