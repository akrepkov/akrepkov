## Hi there! 👋

I'm Anna, a passionate and curious developer with a strong foundation in low-level programming and web technologies. I am graduating from Codam College, where I specialized in C and C++, and I'm currently expanding into data analytics and full-stack development with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.

For several years I’ve been working on everything from website editing and bug fixing to leading community-driven tech projects. I enjoy digging deep into how things work — whether it’s building a custom HTTP server, a basic 3D engine, or a multi-ball Pong game in JavaScript.
