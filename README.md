# Hi there! 👋

I'm Anna, just a regular person with a knack for technology and a passion for problem-solving. My journey has taken me through various roles, shaping me into the person I am today. Over the last 10 years, I've done a bit of everything: from editing websites using **WordPress** and fixing HTML and CSS issues to organizing projects that solve city problems through crowdsourcing.

But life, much like programming, is about adapting and evolving. 2 years ago, I've embarked on a new adventure, diving into data analytics on Coursera and immersing myself in software engineering at Codam College. 

**I began with C**, and I've discovered that it's more than just a programming language; it's like looking behind the scenes of technology, understanding its inner workings. 

Now, I'm expanding my horizons with **C++ and Python**. C++ enhances the capabilities of C with object-oriented programming, while Python offers simplicity and readability with its extensive libraries.
In conclusion, I want to say that my experiences have taught me the art of problem-solving, the importance of teamwork, and the resilience to face setbacks with a smile. After all, in the world of tech, bugs are just unexpected plot twists waiting to be resolved.
