## Hi there! 👋

I'm Anna, a tech enthusiast with a love for problem-solving. Over the past two years, I've been studying software engineering at Codam Coding College, focusing on languages like C, C++, and Python. During this time, I’ve built a strong understanding of how computers work by learning system administration working with Docker to virtualize environments, and understanding key networking protocols like HTTP by developing my own server from scratch.

I've also gained experience in building basic operating system features by creating a simple shell. This taught me how systems handle commands and processes. Working on 3D graphics has sharpened my skills in turning data into visual representations and solving algorithmic problems. These experiences have made me better at writing efficient code and tackling challenges with a practical, hands-on approach.
