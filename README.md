## Hi there! 👋

Hi, I’m Anna — a curious developer who loves learning by building. I’m finishing up at Codam College, where I focused on C and C++, and lately I’ve been diving into full-stack development and modern web tools like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.

Right now, I’m writing a recipe book app in React, learning how to build dashboards with Chart.js, and exploring mobile development with React Native and Expo Go. I enjoy digging into how things work, whether it’s a 3D engine, a custom HTTP server, or a fun little Pong game.
